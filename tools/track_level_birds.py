"""Bird rejection measured where the system actually decides: at the track.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Bird rejection is the hardest thing this pipeline does and the thing the project is sold
on, and until now every "track-level" bird number in this repository was a per-frame
number in disguise: `tools/tracks_to_dets.py` flattens tracks back into per-frame boxes
and `dronedet.metrics` scores those. That answers "how many frames contained a spurious
box", which is not the operational question. The operational question is **how many times
did the system raise a bird as a target**, and a bird raised for 150 consecutive frames is
ONE false alarm to an operator, not 150.

So this scores tracks as tracks. Nothing here is derived from a per-frame AP.

WHAT IS COUNTED, AND AGAINST WHAT
---------------------------------
07_05 carries eight hand-labelled bird tracks (934 boxes, median 6.0 px -- the same size
band as the 8.0 px drone) flagged ``ignore`` in the ground truth. `dronedet.metrics`
treats such objects as *distractors*: real things the detector must not call a drone. They
never contribute to recall, and a hit on one is neither a hit nor a miss on the target --
it is its own outcome. That convention is kept here and lifted to the track level.

Every confirmed track is assigned a ground-truth kind by where the plurality of its frames
sit -- ``target`` / ``bird`` / ``nothing`` -- and cross-tabulated against what the
classifier called it (``drone`` / ``near`` / ``other``). That table is the answer: the
cell [predicted drone x actually bird] is the bird false-alarm count, and it has never
been reported before.

THE CLAUSE MOST LIKELY TO LET A BIRD THROUGH
--------------------------------------------
`dronedet.trackclass` promotes a track to ``drone`` if ``confirmed OR sustained``, where
``sustained`` means ``n_tracked >= LONG_TRACK`` (120 frames) and carries **no appearance
requirement at all**. Its inline justification is that the tracker's directedness filter
has already removed clutter -- but `dronedet/track.py`'s own comment says the opposite:
"Birds pass too -- bird vs drone is an appearance/classifier problem, not a kinematic
one." A bird that flies straight for four seconds is exactly what that clause admits.
So every promotion is attributed to the clause that caused it, and tracks promoted by
``sustained`` ALONE are reported separately. If that number is not zero, it is the single
most important thing on the page.

    NOT every ``ignore`` object is a bird, and conflating them produces a report that is
    exactly backwards. 07_05's ignore set is eight `bird*` tracks (934 instances) **plus
    `near`** -- the *landed drone*, 571 instances, flagged ignore because it is the same
    aircraft sitting on the ground rather than a distractor. Treating `near` as a bird
    made this tool announce "1478 detections on birds" out of 1482 bird instances and a
    bird track classified `near`, when what it had actually found was the detector
    correctly finding the landed drone and the classifier correctly labelling it.

    So birds are identified by name prefix, which is the convention
    `dronedet.metrics.Summary.confuser_hits(prefixes=("bird",))` already uses, and every
