"""Prove the test suite really is torch-free, by running it with torch uninstallable.

CI installs only numpy, scipy, opencv-headless and pytest. A top-level
``import torch`` anywhere in a test's import chain therefore passes on a developer
machine — where torch is present — and fails in CI. That failure mode has a long history
in this repo (`.github/workflows/tests.yml` warns about it), and the
existing defence is a convention: keep such imports lazy, inside the function that needs
them. A convention is not a check.

This is the check. It installs an import blocker ahead of the normal machinery and runs
the suite, so a module-scope ``import torch`` raises loudly *here*, on the machine that
has torch, instead of silently in CI three commits later.

    python tools/check_ci_safety.py                  # run the whole suite blocked
    python tools/check_ci_safety.py dronedet/tests   # a subset

Exit code is the suite's, so it drops straight into a CI job.
