"""The publication figures, each generated from a saved result file and nothing else.

Every figure here reads a JSON artefact produced by an evaluation job. None of them
contain a number typed by hand, so a figure cannot drift from the run that produced it --
and re-running this after a re-evaluation is the whole update procedure.

    fig1_accuracy_vs_size.png    AP against target size, per dataset. THE figure: it is
                                 the one that turns "we lose overall but win on small
                                 targets" from a claim into a curve with error bars.
    fig2_accuracy_vs_speed.png   AP against measured FPS, both arms on one GPU.
    fig3_single_vs_temporal.png  what the three-frame stack actually buys, by size.
    fig4_dt_ablation.png         AP against tap spacing dt.

Inputs, all optional -- a figure whose input is missing is SKIPPED with a message rather
than drawn from defaults. A plausible-looking figure built from absent data is worse than
no figure, because nothing downstream can tell it was invented.

    work/reports/size_curve/{dataset}_{bins}.json   figs 1 and 3
    work/reports/bench/*.json                       fig 2
    work/reports/ablation/dt_sweep.json             fig 4

    PYTHONPATH=. python tools/make_paper_figures.py --results work --out docs/media/paper

Palette and dark canvas match tools/make_result_charts.py so the README reads as one set.
The blue/orange pair is CVD-safe; every series is also named in a legend, so colour never
carries the identity on its own.
