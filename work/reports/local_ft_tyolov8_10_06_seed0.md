# 10_06 — one held-out flight

Protocol `specklock-centre` (centre distance, tau=12 px), 250 labelled instances over 250 frames, resampled as **9 blocks of 30 frames**.

> **This interval is WITHIN ONE SEQUENCE.** It measures whether a difference holds across the segments of this single flight. It is *not* evidence that the difference generalises to another flight — two videos cannot support that claim, and resampling one of them harder does not change what was measured.
